# useful-scripts

Just a place to keep all of my small scripts together, for linux, windows, ios, and android

This included:

Nimbus - a command for ios which starts activator listeners

Texthider - available for windows and linux, hide text in binary files, 

iterm - ssh to iphone from windows, requires windows ssh client, search google on how to enable it

port22.sh - a simple script that makes port 22 redirect to 8022, so you don't need to use port 8022
